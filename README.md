# Notebook Challenge

Welcome, to Javascript programming! Now that you finished (or almost finished)
your CodeAcademy course, let's start working on a project! This little notebook
is a good starting place, because its code was made to look like something you
would find in practice while programming on a environment with coworkers, while
not using obscure tricks created in a hurry (which are, unfortunately, quite
common).

### Setup

Open a Terminal window on this folder, and run (type then press enter) the 
following commands, inserting your password where needed:

    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    sudo npm install -g jsdoc ws
    jsdoc .
    ws

Keep the terminal window open, and open http://localhost:8000/ on your browser.
